				"Though beholders are exceptionally intelligent, they have found little success in learning magic. Most have contented themselves with the natural abilities of the eye tyrant.",
				"Why can’t beholders manipulate the magic that flows so freely through their bodies? The reason is their central eye, that produces the anti-magic ray. Its energies effectively “short circuit” the creature’s magical potential.",
				"A beholder can learn magic if its central eye does not function. The first beholder magi were born blind in this eye and learned magic to compensate. Others ruthlessly put out their own eyes, though these fanatics are nearly always outcast from all beholder nations."
